# clj-bucket

A low-level implementation of the [token bucket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket) algorithm in Clojure.

Function calls are throttled explicitly with the bucket per function call. Buckets are implemented as core.async
channels and are returned to the called in verbatim; this allows the caller to close the bucket when needed.

The [throttler](https://github.com/brunoV/throttler) library served as the original inspiration for this library
(which started as its fork), but it is prone to leak channels in settings where the throttling settings for a given
function need to change. By exposing the throttling channel this library allows the caller to close it and avoid the leak.

## Usage

Add clj-bucket as a dependency to your `project.clj`:

```clj
[clj-bucket 0.1.4]
```

Then in your namespace, import `clj-bucket.core`:

```clj
(require '[clj-bucket.core :refer [bucket throttle]))
```

To create a token bucket:

```clj
(bucket 5 1 :second)
```

This gives you back a bucket that allows 1 function call per second,
with a burstiness (capacity) of 5 tokens in total. Tokens that exceed the capacity
of the bucket are discarded.

Function calls are throttled explicitly per function call with the bucket:

```clj
(throttle bucket + 1 1)
;=> 2
```

If there is a token present in the bucket it will be removed and the function executed.
If the bucket is empty the call will block until a token becomes available.
